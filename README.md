#Shadowrunner

##Introduction

This is the sample readme for the Shadowrun 5th Edition system.

##Purpose

I created this as both a) A way to learn AngularJS and b) As a way to introduce my group of friends into an RPG system that, compared to some, is quite complex BUT in such a fulfilling and creative world. Because of that, I wanted to make it a bit more... consumable for new players.
