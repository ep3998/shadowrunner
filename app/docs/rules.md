###Making Hits
_Rolling Dice_

+ Hits are made with 6-sixed dice (D6) when they roll a 5 or a 6
+ You want # of hits >= the threshold of an action - more hits, the better 
+ Glitches are when you roll >= 50% 1's on a given check
    + If you succeed on a check with a glitch, both occur
    + If you have 0 success and a glitch, it's a critical glitch
    + Can cancel out or downgrade a glitch with __Edge__

_Tests_
Tests come in the shape of the following:

+ Kind of test
+ D6 to roll
+ Limit on the test (max hits) - can be ignored with __Edge__
+ Threshold (min hits)
+ Tests can be retried multiple times with successive -2 dice/retry

Example formats:
__Success__ - Skill + Attribute \[Limit\] (Threshold) Test
EX: Perception + Intuition \[Mental\] (2) Test
Use: Nearly all checks in the game

__Opposed__ - Skill + Attribute \[Limit\] Opposed Test
EX: Sneaking + Agility \[Physical\] Opposed Test
Use: When you need to roll more hits than some opponent

__Extended__ - Skill + Attribute \[Limit\] (Threshold, Interval) Extended Text
EX: Automotive + Logic \[Mental\] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test
Use: When you need to work on something for a long duration of time, you make repeated rolls with X Interval between sets of rolls

__Teamwork__ - Same as above but additional players can contribute their Skill + Attribute to a roll

_Skills_
Skills use a combination of a base attribute (Strength, Willpower...) and your rating/training of that skill. If you don't have a skill but still want to try a test, you can do an `Attribute - 1` check if "defaulting" is allowed. 
+ The skill will state if defaulting is not allowed
+ The final sum of "Attribute + Skill Rating" is how many dice you can roll for that specific test

_Edge_
Edge is the "luck" modifier of the game. It can be used for the following:
+ Push the Limit: Add edge rating to a test - each Edge dice also can be re-rolled again on a 6
+ Second chance: Re-roll all dice that weren't hits
+ Seize the Initiative: Move to the top of initiative order
+ Blitz: Roll 5 Initiative dice for a Combat Turn
+ Close Call: Negate the effects of a glitch/downgrade a critical glitch
+ Dead Man's Trigger: When about to fall unconscious or die, can make a \[Body + Willpower\](3) test to spend any remaining actions before doing so

You can also permanently burn Edge to do the following:
+ Smackdown: Auto succeed an action with 4 hits
+ Not Dead Yet: In a lethal situation (bullet to head, grenade in face), you manage to survive, though still with the consequences of that event (bullet still hits head)

You can regain edge doing the following:
+ Fulfilling meal, good night's sleep 
+ GM privy - good roleplay, heroic acts, achievements of goals, pushing the story forward, etc.
