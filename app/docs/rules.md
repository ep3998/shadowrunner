###Making Hits
_Rolling Dice_

+ Hits are made with 6-sixed dice (D6) when they roll a 5 or a 6
+ You want # of hits >= the threshold of an action - more hits, the better 
+ Glitches are when you roll >= 50% 1's on a given check
    + If you succeed on a check with a glitch, both occur
    + If you have 0 success and a glitch, it's a critical glitch
    + Can cancel out or downgrade a glitch with __Edge__

_Tests_
Tests come in the shape of the following:

+ Kind of test
+ D6 to roll
+ Limit on the test (max hits) - can be ignored with __Edge__
+ Threshold (min hits)
+ Tests can be retried multiple times with successive -2 dice/retry

Example formats:
__Success__ - Skill + Attribute \[Limit\] (Threshold) Test
EX: Perception + Intuition \[Mental\] (2) Test
Use: Nearly all checks in the game

__Opposed__ - Skill + Attribute \[Limit\] Opposed Test
EX: Sneaking + Agility \[Physical\] Opposed Test
Use: When you need to roll more hits than some opponent

__Extended__ - Skill + Attribute \[Limit\] (Threshold, Interval) Extended Text
EX: Automotive + Logic \[Mental\] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test
Use: When you need to work on something for a long duration of time, you make repeated rolls with X Interval between sets of rolls

__Teamwork__ - Same as above but additional players can contribute their Skill + Attribute to a roll
